        Compensation Confirmation â€” Your Contribution Is Recognized
        </h3>

        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
            Dear <strong>Mr. McRobie Gary</strong>,
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
        While your time as <strong>Head of Administration</strong> did not unfold as we had all envisioned, the company acknowledges the effort and creativity you brought forward â€” particularly through your <strong>introduction video</strong>, which has had measurable impact and value.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
        In recognition of your contribution, <strong>Credit Tide Stock Company</strong> is proceeding with a compensation of <strong>$20,000</strong>, credited directly to your stock account. These funds are now available for withdrawal at your discretion.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
        We understand that not every leadership role fits every individual, and while this journey didnâ€™t align with your long-term strengths, it does not diminish the value of what youâ€™ve already earned. Compensation is not conditional on tenure â€” but on delivery, and in this regard, youâ€™ve fulfilled that part of your responsibility.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
        Thank you for your contribution. We wish you the best in your next chapter.
        </p>

        <div style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
        Respectfully,<br>
        Oliver Prill<br>
