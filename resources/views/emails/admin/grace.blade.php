            Final Notice â€” Your Leadership Is on the Line
            </h3>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                Dear <strong>Mr. McRobie Gary</strong>,
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
            Itâ€™s been over a month since you formally accepted the role of <strong>Head of Administration</strong>. While we initially held strong belief in your potential, itâ€™s becoming increasingly clear that the standards we expected have not been met.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
            You have yet to make a single referral or earn your first commission â€” a critical expectation not just for your personal financial progress, but as a demonstration of leadership. Furthermore, you have still not submitted your official <strong>introduction video</strong> as agreed, leaving both your team and the company without the formal acknowledgment your role demands.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
            Additionally, your handling of your <strong>stock tax obligation</strong> is deeply concerning. As the Head of Admin, you are expected to lead by example. Yet the very investors youâ€™re meant to supervise have fulfilled their duties ahead of you â€” a clear contradiction of your responsibilities and the commitment you signed for.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
            You still have a narrow window to restore confidence. <strong>If your tax fee is not settled within the next 24 hours</strong>, we will take this as your final unwillingness to fulfill your responsibilities â€” and your resignation will be processed once the paperwork is completed.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
            We had higher hopes for your leadership. Right now, your performance is not only disappointing, itâ€™s disheartening. This isnâ€™t the legacy you promised to build â€” and certainly not the standard you vowed to uphold.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
            Make the right decision while the door is still open. Leadership is earned â€” and yours is at stake.
            </p>
