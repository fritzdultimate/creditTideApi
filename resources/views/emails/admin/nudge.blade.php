                Dear <strong>Mr. McRobie Gary</strong>,
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                I hope this message finds you well and focused. We truly appreciate the effort youâ€™ve shown so far since taking on your new role as Head of Administration.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                As part of our growth strategy and visibility initiative, we shared with you the official <strong>company flyer and card</strong>, not just as a symbol of leadership â€” but as a tool for immediate traction and outreach. At this point, the company was fully expecting to see your <strong>first or second referral commission already credited</strong> to your account.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                These commissions are designed to be <strong>instantly available for withdrawal</strong>, giving you a financial cushion for your basic needs and momentum to start creating a reliable income cycle. This first win, especially in your role, is essential â€” not just for the numbers, but to validate the consistency and belief the company placed in your appointment.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                We understand that each journey begins with a step, but as of now, <strong>you have yet to earn your first commission</strong> â€” something that, quite frankly, is not the kind of impression we hoped to see at this stage. We urge you to act now, leverage the tools at your disposal, and show us that we made the right decision.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                Letâ€™s turn things around and write the kind of story youâ€™d be proud of. The opportunity is still open. And so is our belief in you.
            </p>
