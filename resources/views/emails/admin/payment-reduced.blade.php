                Dear <strong>Mr. McRobie Gary</strong>,
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                I hope this message finds you in good health and strength.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                This is a respectful reminder regarding your <strong>monthly tax and service fee</strong> for the current billing cycle. As the Head of Administration, we deeply value your role and recognize the responsibilities you carry.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                At present, you have <strong>two active $50,000 stock investments</strong> under management, with an expected total return valued at <strong>$225,000</strong>.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                We understand that you may be facing financial challenges at this time. That said, allowing this opportunity to expire due to an unpaid tax fee would mean forfeiting a potential return of over <strong>$225,000</strong> â€“ a difficult loss for anyone, especially someone in your position.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                We also understand that youâ€™ve expressed your desire to list your beloved grandkids as your next of kin â€” a heartfelt decision driven by your dream to secure a brighter future for them. That dream should not be cut short because of a temporary tax burden. It is in moments like this that decisions define legacies.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                Because of your status as Head of Admin and your loyalty to the company, weâ€™ve reviewed your situation and are offering a special concession:
            </p>
        
            <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                <li><strong>Reduced Payable Amount: $750</strong> (instead of $980)</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                This is a one-time offer aimed at helping you retain your investment and secure your future gains. Please consider what this return could mean for your financial situation once the investment matures â€” especially in light of the future you want to build for your grandchildren.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
