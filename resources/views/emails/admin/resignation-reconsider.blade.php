                Dear <strong>Mr. McRobie Gary</strong>,
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                Thank you for your message, and I genuinely appreciate your honesty and clarity.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                Iâ€™d like to clarify that per company policy, funds issued for investmentâ€”regardless of who may have fronted the capitalâ€”cannot be reversed or returned to any third party, including <strong>Ms. Reese Witherspoon</strong>. Once the capital was transferred under your name and profile, <strong>you became the legal custodian of the investment</strong>, with full rights and responsibilities attached.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                Furthermore, Reese has explicitly expressed she does <strong>not wish to reclaim the funds</strong>. Instead, she continues to hope that you follow through with the original plan â€” not just for the return, but for the legacy itâ€™s meant to build. Itâ€™s important to note that, despite your current differences, she has continued to advocate for you behind the scenes.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                We understand relationships evolve â€” even complicated ones like the one youâ€™ve shared with Reese. But please donâ€™t let that history override the opportunity at hand. This investment was structured to help you build something lasting â€” especially with your grandkids in mind. The fact remains: <strong>your $100,000 is now worth $225,000</strong>. All it takes is a minimal compliance fee to activate its release.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                We are still holding the reduced tax/service amount of <strong>$750</strong> open for you as a sign of respect and belief in your potential. If you truly wish to walk away, weâ€™ll honor that â€” but we urge you to take one more look at whatâ€™s at stake. Not just the money, but the story youâ€™re writing and the future you can still create.
            </p>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(13, 13, 14);">
                Please consider staying the course. We believe in you, Mr. McRobie.
            </p>
